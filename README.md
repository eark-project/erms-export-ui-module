# ERMS Export Module

The purpose of the ERMS Export Module is to extract data and metadata from an CMIS 1.0/1.1 compliant repository into the SMURF format.

An example of an extraction can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L8WVfAZ3C8&index=1&list=PLj-yd-_ObnNfjfKS-lBpThD4xrs-NRAIU)

This GitHub repository contains the code for the frontend of the ERMS Export Module. The code for the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/magenta-aps/E-Ark-Alfresco-export-bridge) (currently: use the develop branch)

**TO-DO:**
Add more documentation...
